# puzzle-server
Server to connect to the database for puzzle web app. 

I set up the database with PostgreSQL and hosted it with ElephantSQL. I populated the database with the use of a JavaScript schema.

I chose to create this server using the Deno runtime as it offers great browser APIs that make writing frontend code really convenient as most of the communication between the client and server can take place through the standardised fetch function.
